	-	Principles of Computer Organization and Architecture Curriculum design
		> A CPU simulating program which shows the data stream in microinstructions between registers, summator, memory and external storage. It consists of a Main Simulation Program(./ModelMachine), a User Interface(./MMWindow) and a Presenting Flash(./ModelMachineFlash). In this course design, I was the team leader and I designed the architecture and worked on the memory simulation and parse program of assembly instruction. In this course design, every member of my team was scored more than 85(full grade point) and I got 92 out of 100.
	-	Principles of Computer Operating System
		-	exp1. Dining Philosophers Problem(report)
		-	exp2. Message Queue - Inter-Process Communication(IPC)(report)

		-	The User Manual(version on console)
-	3rd year
	> In the first semester of this school year, my courses mainly focused on mainframe. And then, I was invited by some friends in startups where I worked mostly as front end engineer and product manager. In this time, I complete severial experiences of Linkopings University. The linux experiences were uploaded to my [github](https://github.com/Tristan-J). After that, I did severial experiences to learn and practice Java. The practices were recorded in my [CSDN blog](http://blog.csdn.net/u012521978).

		-	Java Practices
		> When I did the practices, these notes were just for recording and sharing in Chinese cummunity, so I wrote them in Chinese. They shows the steps of practices and my notes and ideas in practicing. You could see what I was doing from following titles and the presented codes.
